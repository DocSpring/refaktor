description: Re-apply a previously undone refactoring operation
---

The `redo` command re-applies a refactoring that was previously undone.

## Usage

```bash
refaktor redo <OPERATION_ID>
```

## Arguments

- `<OPERATION_ID>` - The unique ID of the operation to redo

## Examples

```bash
# Undo an operation
refaktor undo abc123-20241201-143022

# Change your mind and redo it
refaktor redo abc123-20241201-143022
```

## How It Works

Re-applies the original refactoring operation using the stored plan data.
