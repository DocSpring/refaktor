description: Re-apply a previously undone renaming operation
---

The `redo` command re-applies a renaming that was previously undone.

## Usage

```bash
renamify redo <OPERATION_ID>
```

## Arguments

- `<OPERATION_ID>` - The unique ID of the operation to redo

## Examples

```bash
# Undo an operation
renamify undo abc123-20241201-143022

# Change your mind and redo it
renamify redo abc123-20241201-143022
```

## How It Works

Re-applies the original renaming operation using the stored plan data.
