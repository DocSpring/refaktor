The Refaktor MCP Server enables AI agents to:
- **Plan refactorings** with case-aware transformations
- **Preview changes** in AI-friendly formats
- **Apply changes atomically** with full undo/redo support
- **Manage refactoring history** across your codebase

## What is Refaktor?

Refaktor is a command-line tool that understands different naming conventions and can rename both file contents and the files themselves in a single atomic operation. It's designed for developers who need to refactor codebases safely and efficiently.

Traditional find-and-replace tools work at the text level, but don't understand code conventions. If you want to rename `getUserName` to `fetchUserProfile`, you need to handle:

- `getUserName` (camelCase)
- `get_user_name` (snake_case) 
- `GetUserName` (PascalCase)
- `GET_USER_NAME` (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
- Files like `get-user-name.js`
- Directories like `user-name/`

Refaktor handles all of these automatically in a single operation.

## Quick Example

Rename `getUserName` to `fetchUserProfile` across your entire codebase:

```bash
refaktor rename getUserName fetchUserProfile
```

This automatically handles:
- `getUserName` â†’ `fetchUserProfile`
- `get_user_name` â†’ `fetch_user_profile`  
- `GetUserName` â†’ `FetchUserProfile`
- `GET_USER_NAME` â†’ `FETCH_USER_PROFILE`
- Files like `getUserName.js` â†’ `fetchUserProfile.js`

You can also specify specific paths:
```bash
refaktor rename getUserName fetchUserProfile src/ tests/
```
