## What is Refaktor?

Refaktor is a command-line tool that understands different naming conventions and can rename both file contents and the files themselves in a single atomic operation. It's designed for developers who need to refactor codebases safely and efficiently.

Traditional find-and-replace tools work at the text level, but don't understand code conventions. If you want to rename `getUserName` to `fetchUserProfile`, you need to handle:

- `getUserName` (camelCase)
- `get_user_name` (snake_case) 
- `GetUserName` (PascalCase)
- `GET_USER_NAME` (SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE)
- Files like `get-user-name.js`
- Directories like `user-name/`

Refaktor handles all of these automatically in a single operation.

## Quick Example

Rename `getUserName` to `fetchUserProfile` across your entire codebase:

```bash
refaktor rename getUserName fetchUserProfile
```

This automatically handles:
- `getUserName` → `fetchUserProfile`
- `get_user_name` → `fetch_user_profile`  
- `GetUserName` → `FetchUserProfile`
- `GET_USER_NAME` → `FETCH_USER_PROFILE`
- Files like `getUserName.js` → `fetchUserProfile.js`

You can also specify specific paths:
```bash
refaktor rename getUserName fetchUserProfile src/ tests/
```

## Demo

Watch Refaktor rename itself to `smart_search_and_replace`, then use the renamed binary to change it back:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/DocSpring/refaktor
cd refaktor
cargo build

# Use refaktor to rename itself to smart_search_and_replace
./target/release/refaktor rename refaktor smart_search_and_replace --yes

# Run tests and rebuild with the new name
rm -rf target
cargo test
cargo build

# Now use smart_search_and_replace to rename itself back to refaktor
./target/release/smart_search_and_replace rename smart_search_and_replace refaktor --yes

# Back to the original
rm -rf target
cargo test
cargo build
./target/release/refaktor --help
```

This demonstrates what Refaktor can do: rename entire projects including all code references, 
file names, and directory names - all while maintaining perfect consistency across 
different naming conventions.
