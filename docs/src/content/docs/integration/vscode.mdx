# VS Code Extension

Coming soon! 

A VS Code extension for Refaktor is in development and will provide:

- **Integrated refactoring commands** - Run Refaktor directly from VS Code
- **Visual diff previews** - See changes in VS Code's diff viewer
- **Interactive plan review** - Review and approve changes with UI controls
- **Progress indicators** - Real-time feedback during large operations
- **Undo/redo integration** - Quick access to operation history

## Current Workaround

For now, you can use Refaktor from VS Code's integrated terminal:

1. Open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+``)
2. Run refaktor commands normally:
   ```bash
   refaktor rename oldName newName --preview table
   ```
3. Use VS Code's built-in git integration to review changes
