# MCP Server

Coming soon!

An MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for Refaktor is in development to enable AI integrations with tools like Cursor and Claude.

## Planned Features

- **AI-powered refactoring suggestions** - Get intelligent renaming suggestions
- **Context-aware operations** - AI understands your codebase structure
- **Batch operations** - Apply multiple related refactorings together
- **Safety validation** - AI helps validate refactoring plans before applying
- **Documentation integration** - Automatic documentation updates

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables AI assistants to securely connect to external tools and data sources. An MCP server for Refaktor will allow AI tools to:

- Analyze your codebase for refactoring opportunities
- Suggest safe and consistent naming improvements  
- Execute refactoring operations with proper safety checks
- Integrate refactoring into broader code improvement workflows

## Current AI Workflow

For now, you can use Refaktor with AI assistants by:

1. Asking the AI to suggest refactoring operations
2. Running the suggested commands manually:
   ```bash
   refaktor rename oldName suggestedName --preview table
   ```
3. Having the AI help review the planned changes
