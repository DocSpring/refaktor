title: Why Not Search and Replace?
description: Why don't you just use a search and replace, regex, or sed?

Renaming words in a real codebase is often more complex than a simple search-and-replace. Case styles, separators, acronyms,
filenames, and imports all need to change in sync. This page shows concrete failure modes of
naive search or regex, and how Renamify handles them safely.

> TLDR: Renamify tokenizes identifiers, understands case styles and separators, knows common acronyms, respects boundaries, renames files and directories consistently, previews the plan, and applies changes atomically with undo.

## 1. Case style preservation across variants

Example: rename `acronym` to `inflection_rule`.

Your codebase contains:

```
acronym_set        # snake_case
acronymSet         # camelCase
AcronymSet         # PascalCase
ACRONYM_SET        # SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE
acronym-set        # kebab-case
Acronym-Set        # Train-Case
--exclude-acronyms # CLI flag segment
excludeAcronyms    # mixed-case config key
```

Naive replace produces broken or mixed results:

```
inflection_rule_set          # ok
inflection_ruleSet           # wrong in camel
Inflection_ruleSet           # broken Pascal
INFLECTION_RULE_SET          # ok
inflection_rule-set          # mixed separators
Inflection_rule-Set          # broken Train
--exclude-inflection_rules   # wrong plural placement
excludeInflection_rules      # broken camel suffix
```

Renamify produces consistent, style-aware results:

```
inflection_rule_set
inflectionRuleSet
InflectionRuleSet
INFLECTION_RULE_SET
inflection-rule-set
Inflection-Rule-Set
--exclude-inflection-rules
excludeInflectionRules
```

How: we detect the container style, generate the correct target variant for that style, and only replace full tokens, not substrings.

## 2. Compound word boundaries

Example: rename `File` to `Document`.

Input:

```
FileManager
TempFileHandler
file_manager_service
ProfileImage         # should not change
FileSystemWatcher
```

Naive regex can overmatch:

```
ProfileImage -> ProDocumentImage   # wrong
```

Renamify honors token boundaries:

```
FileManager        -> DocumentManager
TempFileHandler    -> TempDocumentHandler
file_manager_service -> document_manager_service
ProfileImage       -> ProfileImage
FileSystemWatcher  -> DocumentSystemWatcher
```

## 3. Acronym intelligence for matching

Acronyms are common: `HTTPSConnection`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `parseURL`, `ID`, `URLParser`.

Renamify’s tokenizer understands acronym spans for matching:

- `HTMLGenerator` is parsed as `HTML` + `Generator`, so searches for `html_generator` or `HTMLGenerator` both match correctly.
- `URLParser` matches as `URL` + `Parser`, not `UR` + `LParser`.
- `Rename-Tool-CLI` is Train-Case with an acronym tail. Searching for `rename_tool` correctly matches the `Rename-Tool` subspan and preserves `-CLI`.

Acronym matching is configurable:
- `--no-acronyms` disables acronym-aware matching.
- `--include-acronyms "API,CLI,ID"`
- `--exclude-acronyms "ID"`
- `--only-acronyms "API,CLI"`

> Note: snake_case is always lower for matching and rendering. Screaming snake is the uppercase variant.
> Acronym options affect matching detection and case inference, not whether snake uses uppercase.

## 4. File and directory renaming with consistency

Renamify updates file and directory names alongside contents, in the right order, and checks for collisions.

Example: rename `smart_search_and_replace` to `renamify`.

It handles:

```
/smart_search_and_replace/                  -> /renamify/
/docs/smart-search-and-replace-guide.md     -> /docs/renamify-guide.md
smart_search_and_replace.exe                -> renamify.exe
SmartSearchAndReplace.java                  -> Renamify.java
```

And updates common import patterns:

```
import smart_search_and_replace.core    -> import renamify.core
require('smart-search-and-replace')     -> require('renamify')
use smart_search_and_replace::scanner;  -> use renamify::scanner;
```

Root directory rename is suggested with a ready-to-paste snippet and opt-in flag to perform automatically.

## 5. Hyphenated mixed-style patterns

Real-world examples:

```
SmartSearchAndReplace-specific
smart-search-and-replace-Guide
Run-SmartSearchAndReplace
```

Renamify treats the hyphen as a separator between differently styled segments, replaces only the matching subspan, and preserves each segment's style. For example:

```
Rename-Tool-CLI  -> Code-Transform-Engine-CLI
```

This works because the tokenizer classifies the segment as Train-Case with an acronym tail, not as generic “mixed”.

## 6. Special tokens that must be preserved

Renamify never splits these incorrectly:

- `arm64`, `amd64`
- `2FA`
- `K8S`
- `project1`, `b2b`, `b2c`

These are single tokens with digits and are preserved in style-aware replacements.

## 7. Round-trip preservation

Renames must be reversible without drift:

```
project1 -> workspace1 -> project1
b2b_sales -> b2c_sales -> b2b_sales
ARM64_ARCH -> X86_ARCH -> ARM64_ARCH
```

Renamify tracks exact tokenization and case rules so round-trips restore the original.
We run end-to-end roundtrip tests on CI to ensure we catch any unhandled edgecases.

## 8. Safety and previews

- Ignores binaries and build artifacts by default. (Same rules as ripgrep, same -u, -uu, -uuu flags.)
- Honors `.gitignore`, `.ignore`, `.rgignore`, and `.rnignore`.
- Plan and preview before apply.
- Apply is atomic with rollback and undo history.

## Real-world complexity: renaming `URL` to `WebAddress`

Challenges include:
- `URLParser`, `parseURL`, `HTTPS_URL`, `url_encoder`
- Plurals like `URLs` vs `WebAddresses`
- Words that only contain `URL` but are different, like `CURL`
- Literals and comments, like `https://example.com/url` or `@param {URL}`
- Constants like `URL_PATTERN`
- Filenames like `url_utils.js` that should become `web_address_utils.js`

Renamify handles matching and boundaries so you can review a single plan and apply confidently.
