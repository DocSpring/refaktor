  In computer programming, self-hosting is the use of a program as part of the toolchain or operating 
  system that produces new versions of that same programâ€”for example, a compiler that can compile 
  its own source code.

Refaktor is capable of "self-hosting". It can rename the entire project to `awesome_file_renaming_tool`, 
run the entire test suite, and then use the newly compiled binary to rename itself back again:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/DocSpring/refaktor
cd refaktor
cargo build

# Use refaktor to rename itself to awesome_file_renaming_tool
./target/debug/refaktor rename refaktor awesome_file_renaming_tool --preview table --yes

# Make sure the old compiled binary is gone
rm -rf target

# Run the full test suite
cargo test

# Build the "awesome_file_renaming_tool" binary
cargo build

# Use the new binary to rename itself back to refaktor
./target/debug/awesome_file_renaming_tool rename awesome_file_renaming_tool refaktor --preview table --yes

# Back to the original name
rm -rf target
cargo test
cargo build
./target/debug/refaktor --help

git status
# On branch main
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

You can use Refaktor to rename an entire project including all code references, 
comments, documentation, file names, and directory names, all while maintaining 
perfect consistency across different naming conventions.

P.S. We run all these steps on CI as an end-to-end integration test:
