  In computer programming, self-hosting is the use of a program as part of the toolchain or operating 
  system that produces new versions of that same programâ€”for example, a compiler that can compile 
  its own source code.

Watch Refaktor rename the entire project to `awesome_file_renaming_tool`, run the test suite 
using it's new name, and then use the new binary to change itself back again:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/DocSpring/refaktor
cd refaktor
cargo build --release

# Use refaktor to rename itself to awesome_file_renaming_tool
./target/release/refaktor rename refaktor awesome_file_renaming_tool --preview table --yes

# Remove the old binary, run tests, and rebuild with the new name
rm -rf target
cargo test
cargo build --release

# Now use the new renamed binary to rename itself back to refaktor
./target/release/awesome_file_renaming_tool rename awesome_file_renaming_tool refaktor --preview table --yes

# Back to the original
rm -rf target
cargo test
cargo build --release
./target/release/refaktor --help

git status
# On branch main
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

# nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

You can use Refaktor to rename an entire project including all code references, 
comments, documentation, file names, and directory names, all while maintaining 
perfect consistency across different naming conventions.

P.S. We run all these steps on CI as an end-to-end integration test:
