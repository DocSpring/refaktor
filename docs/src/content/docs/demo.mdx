Watch Refaktor rename itself to `smart_search_and_replace`, then use the renamed binary to change it back:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/DocSpring/refaktor
cd refaktor
cargo build

# Use refaktor to rename itself to smart_search_and_replace
./target/release/refaktor rename refaktor smart_search_and_replace --yes

# Remove the old binary, run tests, and rebuild with the new name
rm -rf target
cargo test
cargo build

# Now use the new smart_search_and_replace binary to rename itself back to refaktor
./target/release/smart_search_and_replace rename smart_search_and_replace refaktor --yes

# Back to the original
rm -rf target
cargo test
cargo build
./target/release/refaktor --help

git status
# On branch main
# Your branch is up to date with 'origin/main'.

# nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

You can use Refaktor to rename entire projects including all code references, 
file names, and directory names - all while maintaining perfect consistency across 
different naming conventions.
