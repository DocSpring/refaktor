# VS Code Extension is Coming soon!

Our VS Code extension will also work in Cursor.

A VS Code extension for Renamify is in development and will provide:

- **Integrated renaming commands** - Run Renamify directly from VS Code
- **Visual diff previews** - See changes in VS Code's diff viewer
- **Interactive plan review** - Review and approve changes with UI controls
- **Progress indicators** - Real-time feedback during large operations
- **Undo/redo integration** - Quick access to operation history

## Current Workaround

For now, you can use Renamify from VS Code's integrated terminal:

1. Open the integrated terminal (`Ctrl+``)
2. Run renamify commands normally:
   ```bash
   renamify rename oldName newName --preview table
   ```
3. Use VS Code's built-in git integration to review changes
