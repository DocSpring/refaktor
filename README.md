# Refaktor

Smart search & replace for code and files with case-aware transformations and built-in undo/redo.

## Demo: Refaktor Refactoring Itself! ðŸ¤¯

Watch Refaktor rename itself to `smart_search_and_replace`, then use the renamed binary to change it back:

```bash
# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/DocSpring/refaktor
cd refaktor
cargo build --release

# Use refaktor to rename itself to smart_search_and_replace
./target/release/refaktor plan refaktor smart_search_and_replace
./target/release/refaktor apply

# Rebuild with the new name
rm -rf target
cargo build --release

# Now use smart_search_and_replace to rename itself back to refaktor!
./target/release/smart_search_and_replace plan smart_search_and_replace refaktor
./target/release/smart_search_and_replace apply

# Back to the original
rm -rf target
cargo build --release
./target/release/refaktor --help
```

This demonstrates Refaktor's power: it can rename entire projects including all code references, file names, directory names, and even the binary itself - all while maintaining perfect consistency across different naming conventions!
